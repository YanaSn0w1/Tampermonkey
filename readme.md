# Description
- Mode 1:
- Will follow back up to 14 every 15 minutes.
- Will skip default pic, no bio and keywords if enabled.
- Will do 1 initial check then another smaller set to 50.
- Mode 2:
- Will unfollow based on same conditions as above + non mutual.
- 150 every 15 minutes starting from first to be safe.
- Stops every 200 cells for 30 seconds to avoid rate limit.

# Description
- 1.1.0 added: If not FB 14 then click home, click top post, scroll to bottom, follow verified only.
- 1.1.0 bugs: Out of ram screens in a VM? possibly from logging and caching so much.
- Only does 1 top post from home. Needs to be able to move each one to the offset and click it when reaches top so it can do 14 every time.
- Does not go to verified when timer 0 sometimes, if the post did not contain someone to follow?
- Does not need to go to home once found 14 can just stop.
- Needs to wait 15 and set timer if got rate limit message or the max day follow message.
- Unfollow not working.
- 1.1.1 un tested, attempt to fix all bugs at once.
